# Why MDX?

MDX is a powerful format that brings together multiple content types into a cohesive whole:

## The Power of Integration

MDX combines:
- **Unstructured content** via Markdown
- **Typed schemas** via JSON-LD/YAML-LD
- **Structured data** via YAML frontmatter
- **Executable code** via JavaScript/TypeScript
- **UI components** via JSX/React

This integration allows you to write content that is both rich in functionality and maintainable.

## Markdown + JSX

At its core, MDX allows you to use JSX in your Markdown content. This means you can:

1. Write content in familiar Markdown syntax
2. Import and use React components
3. Pass data between components
4. Create interactive documentation

### Example

```mdx

# {frontmatter.title}

Here's a regular markdown paragraph.

<Alert type="info">
  This is a React component in the middle of Markdown!
</Alert>

- List items work
- Just like regular markdown
- But you can also use <Highlight>components inline</Highlight>
```

## Why Choose MDX?

1. **Component Reusability**: Use the same components across your documentation
2. **Rich Interactivity**: Add interactive elements without leaving your content
3. **Type Safety**: Get TypeScript support for your components
4. **Data Integration**: Access frontmatter data in your components
5. **Flexible Styling**: Style your content using your preferred CSS solution

## MDX + Linked Data = MDX-LD

MDX-LD extends MDX by adding:
- YAML-LD support in frontmatter
- Typed data structures
- Semantic relationships between content
- Enhanced component props typing

This combination creates a powerful system for creating rich, interactive content with proper data structures and relationships.
